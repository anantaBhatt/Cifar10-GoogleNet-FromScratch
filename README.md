# Cifar10-GoogleNet-FromScratch

1. Load the Cifar10 Dataset
2.Define the Googlenet blocks: Set the convolution layers
3. Set the Learning Rate Scheduler , epoch as 30 and batch size as 128. Call the inception googlenet for performance
4. Train the augmented data with epoch as 30
5. Evaluate the inception model for training and test
